Jerry Ying-Tao Zhao<br>
Assistant Professor<br>
yzhao47@nyit.edu<br>
  <br>
  BS, Economics, <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/">Nanjing University</a> (2005)<br>
  PhD, Bioinformatics, <a href="http://english.genetics.cas.cn/">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (2010)<br>
  Postdoc, Neuroepigenetics, <a href="https://home.www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a><br>
 <br>


Jerry was an undergraduate at Nanjing University, where he worked on models of economic growth. He was inspired by the Human Genome Project and moved to Beijing in 2005 to pursue his PhD in Bioinformatics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. There, he worked with Dr. Xiu-Jie Wang developing computational methods to characterize non-coding RNAs. In September 2011, Jerry joined Joe Zhou's lab at the University of Pennsylvania, where he investigated the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of Rett syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Jerry started his independent career as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at NYIT in July 2019. 



 <h3>Research Scientist</h3>

 <br>
Austin Meadows<br>
Research Technician<br>
ameado01@nyit.edu<br>
  <br>
  B.E., Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University (2018)<br>
  B.S., Applied Math and Statistics, Stony Brook University (2018)<br>
 <br>

Austin completed his undergraduate education at Stony Brook University in the Biomedical Engineering program, picking up a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Math and Statistics along the way. His specialization was in tissue engineering, the application of biomedical engineering principles at the tissue- and cellular-level. At Stony Brook Austin worked in a lab whose research focused on leveraging microfluidics for quantitative biology and genomics, wherein he developed and built several custom devices including a microbead magnetic rheometer for quantifying hydrogels, an environmental chamber for long-duration mammalian cell microscopy, and an automated turbidostat for yeast evolution studies. He's always working on one project or another, and loves collaborating with and learning from others.



 
 <h3>Medical School Student </h3>
Matan Kadosh<br>

Matan was born and raised in Dallas, Tx, attended the University of Missouri, and currently lives in the heart of New York City. He is curious about the associations between genetics and disease and hopes to incorporate life-long learning throughout his career. He previously studied different mouse models of ALS at both the University of Missouri and Columbia University. Matan is an avid reader and enjoys spending time with friends and family. He is very excited to be discovering and learning in the Long Gene Lab.<br>


Brian Tang<br>

Brian is a graduate of Baruch College (CUNY) and was part of the CUNY Baccalaureate for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies with concentrations in Biochemistry and Behavioral Neuroscience. He previously worked in a Drosophila lab in which he utilized bioinformatics and wet lab techniques to study genetic influences on the proliferation of crystal cells that are involved in fly immunity. He wrote his undergraduate honors thesis titled “Genetic Basis of Larval Crystal Cell Quantity Variation in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP).” In the Long Gene Lab, Brian is interested in learning more about integrating bioinformatics and medicine to study genetic related disorders, that can lead to providing patients with more personalized medicine. When he is not studying, he enjoys cooking foods of different cultures and watching anime during his spare time.<br>

 <br>
Yura Kim<br>

Yura is an undergraduate student at New York Institute of Technology in the College of Arts and Sciences. She is currently finishing her third year of the 7 year combined degree program that awards a Bachelor of Science in Life Sciences and a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Yura hopes to complete her undergraduate studies and matriculate into NYITCOM this upcoming Fall of 2020. At NYIT, Yura took many courses concentrated in the core sciences including biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, genetics, and more. She recently finished a biomedical research course where she learned about TERM (tissue engineering and regenerative medicine) and the various lab techniques used in research. In her free time, Yura enjoys volunteering and advocating for children with disabilities. She looks forward to learning more about long genes and gaining research experience. <br>
