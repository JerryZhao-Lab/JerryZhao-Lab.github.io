<h1 id="welcometothejerryzhaolab">Welcome to the Jerry Zhao Lab!</h1>

<p>We are part of the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine/department_of_biomedical_sciences">Department of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Innovation Center in the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine">College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> at the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/">New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)</a>.<br>
  <br></p>

<p>Research in the Jerry Zhao Lab is focused on neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neuroepigenomics. We are particularly interested in the role of heparan sulfate and long genes in brain health and disease. Heparan sulfate is a type of glycosaminoglycan that presents on the surface of all human cells and is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Long genes (> 100 kilobases) are highly expressed in the brain, show unique genomic and epigenomic features, and are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome. Lastly, we are also actively developing Machine Learning algorithms to integrate biomedical and clinical data. <br></p>

<p>The lab utilizes multidisciplinary approaches including animal disease models, mouse genetics, neuroscience, genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology.<br>
