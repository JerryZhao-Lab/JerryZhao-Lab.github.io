<h1 id="welcometothejerryzhaolab">Welcome to the Jerry Zhao Lab!</h1>

<p>We are part of the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine/department_of_biomedical_sciences">Department of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Innovation Center in the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine">College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/">New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)</a>.<br>
  <br></p>

<p>Research in the Jerry Zhao Laboratory directed by Dr. <a href="https://JerryZhaoLab.github.io/members"><strong>Jerry Yingtao Zhao</strong></a> is focused on leveraging multidisciplinary approaches to understand long genes, particularly their transcription, co-transcriptional processing, and evolution. We are also interested in heparan sulfate, which is a type of glycosaminoglycan that presents on the surface of most cells and in the extracellular matrix. Lastly, we are actively applying Machine Learning algorithms to discover new biomedical information from omics data.<br>
 <br></p>

<p>The lab utilizes multidisciplinary approaches including genomics, bioinformatics, computational biology, molecular biology, and mouse genetics.<br>
