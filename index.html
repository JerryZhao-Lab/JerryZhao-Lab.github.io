<h1 id="welcometothejerryzhaolab">Welcome to the Jerry Zhao Lab!</h1>

<p>We are part of the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine/department_of_biomedical_sciences">Department of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Innovation Center in the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/medicine">College of Osteopathic Medicine</a> at the <a href="https://www.nyit.edu/">New York Institute of Technology (NYIT)</a>.<br>
  <br></p>

<p>Research in the Jerry Zhao Lab combines <span style="color:tomato;">genomics</span> and neurobiology to understand the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neuroepigenetics. We are particularly interested in the role of heparan sulfate and long genes in brain health and disease. (1) Heparan sulfate is a glycosaminoglycan that covers the surface of all human cells. Heparan sulfate plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. (2) Long genes (> 100 kilobases) are highly expressed in the brain and show unique genomic and epigenomic features. Long genes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome. (3) Lastly, we are also actively developing Machine Learning algorithms to integrate biomedical and clinical data. <br></p>

<p>The lab uses multidisciplinary approaches including animal disease models, mouse genetics, neuroscience, genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology.<br>
