# The research focus of the Long Gene Lab, by name, is long genes.

## 1. Understand the transcription and co-transcriptional processing of long genes.<br>
The lengths of protein-coding genes in the human genome range from 0.2 kilobases to 2400 kilobases. Long genes consume more time and resources to make a transcript because gene transcription relies on RNA polymerase II traveling along the entire gene region. Notably, long genes are preferentially dysregulated in multiple human diseases. However, despite the increasing impact of long genes on human health, we have a very limited understanding of how long genes are transcriptionally and co-transcriptionally regulated. We hypothesize that long genes require specific chromatin features, such as histone modifications, to overcome the length constraint for efficient transcription and co-transcriptional processing. Our goal is to elucidate how chromatin features in long genes affect Pol II activities and pre-mRNA splicing.

## 2. Illuminate the role of long genes in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).<br>
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong developmental disability that affects 1 in 59 children. Hundreds of thousands of families are suffering from ASD. These sufferings can be greatly relieved by therapeutic treatment or cure of ASD. However, this is no cure for ASD so far, largely due to the lack of a good understanding of its molecular mechanisms. These molecular mechanisms are crucial for identifying therapeutic targets. Particularly, a molecular abnormality shared by the large majority of ASD individuals will be an ideal therapeutic target, because it has the potential to help a large portion of ASD individuals. We recently find that misregulation of long genes could be a molecular abnormality shared by the large majority of ASD individuals. We plan to illuminate the role of the misregulation of long genes in ASD etiology. Our research will provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ASD and a potential therapeutic target, which will hopefully facilitate the development of ASD treatment and eventually alleviate the suffering of ASD individuals and their families. <br>  


## 3. Discover new biomedical information from omics data using Machine Learning algorithms.<br>
Biomedical research has experienced an explosion of new data in the past few years. However, many of these data were generated to test pre-defined hypotheses, indicating that new biomedical information unrelated to the hypotheses may remain hidden in the data. Machine Learning algorithms uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and other insights through examining large-scale datasets, which provide a feasible opportunity to develop efficient and effective approaches to discover new information from omics datasets. This new information might be a stepping stone for further biomedical investigations. Thus, we plan to apply Machine Learning algorithms in omics data to discover new biomedical information.
